# Jlox ‚öôÔ∏è

A tree-walk interpreter in Java for the [Lox Programming Language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), created by Robert Nystrom.

This project serves the dual purpose of enhancing my profficency in Java and providing me with hands-on experience in understanding the intricacies of interpreter design.

The code expands on the features of jlox, from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (amazing book!).
